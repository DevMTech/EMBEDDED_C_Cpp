	Big-O analysis
	bit-twiddling challenges
	They'll started out with only a vague problem statement, you really have to ask a lot of questions to figure out what is expected.
	Know your binary trees and hash tables. 
	hash-table implementation in C
	Nested strings in parenthesis to be repeated the number of times mentioned by an index alongside in square brackets.
	If you didn't have access to the functions malloc() and free(), describe how you would implement them.
	
	Coding challenge: It was a problem related to a board game with particular rules  and  the state of a piece in the board needed to be checked. There was a dependence on the pieces in neighbors cells  and a recursive  solution was forbidden.
	I used a stack to mimic the function that a recursive set of function calls  would have similarly to a depth first search.

	computer architecture, memory hierarchy, and assembly language programming for CPU architectures 
	a singly linked-list in C code
	dynamic programming problems 	
	
	basic algorithms: selection sort, exchange sort, quicksort, heapsort or mergesort, use of lists, stacks, 
	(priority) queues, trees and tries; 
	but graphs are even more important: depth first traversal, breadth first, Kruskal, Prim. 
	You should certainly know how to do all these using the standard libraries for your language, but the more you can do without libraries the better.

	https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-experience/336276/Google-or-Embedded-Software-Engineer-or-Reject/307033
    Embedded Coding Question.
    Write a driver wrapper API on top of an existing driver API.
    Driver API

        size_t read(size_t* buf)   // this driver API reads 512 bytes from a pheripheral 
         
         // Write wrapper as below 
        size_t read_bytes(struct *rs, size_t* buf, size_t count) // You need to return count bytes in the buffer. 

	The interviewer did not explain the problem rather asked me to go throw the problem written on 
	a google document. It took me little time to understand the trick involved. 
	Since the driver API reads only 512 bytes you need to cache the data inside the wrapper API 
	when the caller wants to read less. 
	The 'rs' variable can maintain a state machine to know whether you have something read 
	in your internal buffer on not.
	
	size_t read_bytes(struct *rs,size_t* buf,size_t count)
	{
		int readBytes = 0;
		bool dataToRead = true;
		char tmp[512];

		while(dataToRead && readBytes<count)
		{
			int bytesFromPeri = read(tmp);//assuming read() returns the number of bytes read from the peripheral
			dataToRead = bytesFromPeri < 512; 
			int toBeCopied = min(bytesFromPeri,count);

			//copying the data to buf
			for(int i = 0; i<toBeCopied ;i++)
			{	buf[readBytes++] = tmp[i];
			}

		}

		return readBytes;
	}
	
	
	find largest binary gap in a given byte; than in a 64 bit-number, etc.
	first - naively; then employ lookup table (for byte); than break down the given number into bytes 
	- but also create lookup table for number of leading and trailing zeros in each byte, etc.

Implement Hash-table + linked list vs Hash-table + tree?
https://github.com/itankar/ds_and_algorithms

MIT Introduction to Algorithms
https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-fall-2011/

- Computer Architecture: To answer anything embedded (and around CPUs and Memory). 

- C language: to deal with memory and embedded type of problems. Function Pointers, struct, C99

- Python: to deal with a problem that is high level and would take too long to code in C.

- Embedded System Design: I referred to Frank Vahid's book to refresh the design tricks usually used.

Cracking the coding interview Book

Operating Systems concepts — race conditions, threading, thread-safe access, deadlocks, ways to detect and avoid those, usage of mutexes, semaphores,

Bluetooth keyboard HID driver

could break the problem to use threads, attach to different cores and structure the computation to have all the required data in the Caches the execution speed would become -

(number of threads) * (number of cores) * (cache hit time).

	
[Google]
I spend most of my time writing lower level C code (sometimes assembly code as needed), 
OS kernel code, browsing driver code bases, reading IP specs, 
reverse engineering and spreading the learnings with my teammates :)

[Intel]
I worked as a Embedded Software Engineer, implementing drivers and stack for Bluetooth (Primarily  in C and Python). 
I've also coded firmware modules (memory manager and some math algorithms) for a GNSS chip during my internship at Intel. 
And, lately I've been studying the Bluetooth RF chain and developing a software tool to control 
the RF Peripheral registers of the controller discretely. 
I am comfortable working both with software and hardware design/development.

I am personally interested in Hardware-Software co-design/development for solutions 
which need to be scalable, fast and maintainable using RISCV/ARM, FPGA(verilog/system verilog), 
Linux and C (or assembly, C++, Python). I am comfortable working with huge code bases. 
I like working in teams and on projects that involve a multi-disciplinary touch (System level, Hardware level, firmware level etc).

[Others]
I spend most of my free time digging into Software-Hardware Design. 

You can browse through few of my projects (put on github):

1. 32 Bit MIPS Processor design and Implementation for DE1Soc FPGA (under active development): 
Implements the minimum MIPS ISA for a 32 bit single cycle processor. git: https://github.com/pitankar/mips-cpu

2. OS Implementation for a 32 bit ARM Controller (under active development): Implements a scheduler 
for ARM Cortex M4 processors in C. git: https://github.com/pitankar/arm-rtos

3. Random Hardware design implementation for FPGA: git: https://github.com/pitankar/FPGA-Designs
